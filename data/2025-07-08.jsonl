The latter\nrequirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the\nintended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment\nenvironments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit\nof the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon\nknown as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem\nsetting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal\nmisgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal\nmisgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum\nexpected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)\nobjective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method\nof domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in\nprocedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based\nunsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal\nmisgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases).

In this work, we conduct the first investigation\ninto distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the\ntransferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is\nprohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's\nattention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge.

In this paper, we propose\nNeighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer\nframework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a\nself-teaching paradigm.

Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two\ncomplementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess\nintra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented\ntasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and\nessential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's\ncapability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein\nfunction annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism\nanalysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,\nconsisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language\nmodel-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI\nmodels have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional\nproperties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world\nbiological applications.

A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model\nthe same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation.
