### [1] [Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559)
*Amirhossein Sadough,Mahyar Shahsavari,Mark Wijtvliet,Marcel van Gerven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAD是一种基于在线去相关学习的实时异常检测方法，适用于高维多变量时间序列，具有高效性和内存友好性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工业物联网的兴起，实时异常检测需求激增，需要处理高维流数据且无需存储历史实例的方法。

Method: DAD通过动态学习和监控数据的相关结构，逐样本处理数据，实现单次通过的高效检测。

Result: 实验表明，DAD在多种异常类型上表现优于现有方法，尤其适合高维实时数据流。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果和计算效率之间取得平衡，为实时内存受限的异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

### [2] [BEAVER: Building Environments with Assessable Variation for Evaluating Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07769)
*Ruohong Liu,Jack Umenberger,Yize Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了强化学习在建筑能源管理中的泛化能力，提出了多目标上下文RL问题，并构建了评估基准，发现现有方法在环境变化下性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习在建筑能源管理中的可扩展性和泛化能力，解决跨环境和多目标任务的挑战。

Method: 形式化多目标上下文RL问题，参数化上下文信息，并构建评估基准。

Result: 现有多目标RL方法能在冲突目标间取得平衡，但在环境变化下性能下降。

Conclusion: 需在策略学习中融入动态相关的上下文信息以提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

### [3] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)
*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于非可训练、确定性输入嵌入的构造性方法，用于大型语言模型的扩展，支持模块化组合和逐层增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的扩展方法资源密集且缺乏灵活性，需要一种更高效、灵活的开发范式。

Method: 利用固定嵌入作为通用接口，实现模块化组合（专家模型合并）和逐层增长训练。

Result: 模块化组合提升了推理性能（如MMLU），逐层增长训练稳定且能逐步提升复杂推理能力（如SQuAD）。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI开发提供了更生物化、构造性的范式，支持资源高效扩展和持续学习。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

### [4] [Space-Filling Regularization for Robust and Interpretable Nonlinear State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07792)
*Hermann Klein,Max Heinz Herkersdorf,Oliver Nelles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的空间填充正则化方法，通过数据分布惩罚改善状态空间中的数据分布，提升训练效果和模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态轨迹变形导致状态空间数据覆盖不足，影响训练算法效果、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于数据分布的正则化惩罚，结合建模和实验设计思想，提出两种正则化技术。

Result: 在局部仿射状态空间模型中验证了方法的有效性，并在系统辨识基准测试中展示了结果。

Conclusion: 新方法改善了状态空间数据分布，提升了训练效果和模型的可解释性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

### [5] [FACap: A Large-scale Fashion Dataset for Fine-grained Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07135)
*François Gardères,Shizhe Chen,Camille-Sovanneary Gauthier,Jean Ponce*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型，用于解决时尚领域的组合图像检索（CIR）任务，显著提升了细粒度文本检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法在通用领域表现良好，但在时尚领域因词汇丰富多样且缺乏大规模标注数据集而表现不佳。

Method: 构建FACap数据集，采用两阶段标注流程（VLM+LLM）；提出FashionBLIP-2模型，基于BLIP-2微调，引入轻量适配器和多头查询-候选匹配。

Result: FashionBLIP-2在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ上表现显著提升，尤其在细粒度文本检索任务中。

Conclusion: FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型有效解决了时尚领域CIR的挑战，适用于电商等高需求场景。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

### [6] [Automating Evaluation of Diffusion Model Unlearning with (Vision-) Language Model World Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07137)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Henry Kvinge,Timothy Doster,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化工具autoeval-dmun，用于评估扩散模型中的信息遗忘效果，并揭示了语言模型在语义排序和对抗提示方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器遗忘（MU）在扩散模型中难以验证信息是否完全清除及可能损害模型性能的问题。

Method: 利用（视觉）语言模型提取结构化知识，识别可能受损的邻近概念，并通过对抗提示绕过遗忘。

Result: 语言模型能有效排序邻近概念（与遗忘损害相关）并生成对抗提示绕过遗忘。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun为评估扩散模型遗忘效果提供了自动化解决方案，并展示了语言模型的潜力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

### [7] [GNNs Meet Sequence Models Along the Shortest-Path: an Expressive Method for Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07138)
*Francesco Ferrini,Veronica Lachi,Antonio Longa,Bruno Lepri,Andrea Passerini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SP4LP是一个结合GNN和最短路径序列建模的新框架，用于高效捕捉多跳依赖关系，提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法难以捕捉链接特定的结构模式，且现有注入结构上下文的方法要么计算成本高，要么依赖简单启发式方法。

Method: SP4LP先通过GNN计算节点表示，再提取候选节点对的最短路径并用序列模型处理节点嵌入序列。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中达到最先进性能，理论证明其表达能力优于标准GNN和其他结构特征方法。

Conclusion: SP4LP是一种通用且原则性的链接预测方法，能高效捕捉多跳关系模式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

### [8] [Exploring Sparse Adapters for Scalable Merging of Parameter Efficient Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07140)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了稀疏适配器作为模块化架构构建块的潜力，提出了一种简单高效的训练方法，并在多任务合并中表现优于LoRA和全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稀疏适配器作为模块化架构的构建块，以实现在不额外微调的情况下快速适应下游任务。

Method: 提出了一种简单的稀疏适配器训练方法，并研究了其在多任务合并中的性能。

Result: 稀疏适配器在合并后表现出优于LoRA和全模型合并的分布内性能，但所有方法在分布外性能上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器是模块化架构的有效构建块，但在分布外任务上仍需改进。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

### [9] [Str-GCL: Structural Commonsense Driven Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07141)
*Dongxiao He,Yongqi Huang,Jitao Zhao,Xiaobao Wang,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Str-GCL是一种新颖的图对比学习框架，通过一阶逻辑规则显式整合结构常识，提升表示学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图对比学习方法主要关注隐式语义关系，忽略了图中结构和属性中的结构常识，这些常识对表示学习至关重要。

Method: Str-GCL利用一阶逻辑规则表示结构常识，并通过表示对齐机制将其整合到对比学习框架中，不改变原图结构。

Result: 实验表明，Str-GCL优于现有方法，为图表示学习提供了新视角。

Conclusion: Str-GCL首次将结构常识直接引入图对比学习，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

### [10] [Understanding Malware Propagation Dynamics through Scientific Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07143)
*Karthik Pappu,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合科学机器学习的混合方法，用于更准确地建模恶意软件传播，并通过实验证明其优于传统和纯神经方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模恶意软件传播对设计有效的网络安全防御至关重要，尤其是针对实时演化的自适应威胁。传统方法和纯神经方法未能完全捕捉现实网络中的非线性反馈机制。

Method: 论文评估了三种方法：经典常微分方程（ODEs）、通用微分方程（UDEs）和神经ODE。通过Code Red蠕虫爆发数据，验证了UDE方法的优势。

Result: UDE方法将预测误差降低了44%，同时保持了可解释性。通过符号恢复方法，揭示了网络饱和、安全响应和恶意软件变种演化等抑制机制。

Conclusion: 混合物理信息模型在预测准确性和动态洞察力上优于纯分析和纯神经方法，支持早期预警系统和针对性防御策略的开发。

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CCQ是一种针对大语言模型（LLM）的2.0-2.75位量化方法，显著降低推理成本且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理成本高和部署难度大的问题，尤其是低比特量化（如3位以下）带来的精度和效率下降。

Method: 结合硬件感知的位移编码与解码、卷积码、混合编码和码簇技术，构建无查找表的编码空间，优化推理性能。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3和ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B压缩至184GB和89GB，实现单GPU部署。

Conclusion: CCQ在极低比特条件下显著提升LLM的推理效率，同时保持高精度，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

*Zixuan Huang,Kecheng Huang,Lihao Yin,Bowei He,Huiling Zhen,Mingxuan Yuan,Zili Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-Guard是一种基于注意力感知的GNN输入分类器，用于防御LLMs的多轮越狱攻击，效果优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）易受多轮越狱攻击，传统单轮攻击防御方法难以应对。

Method: 提出G-Guard，通过构建实体图捕捉多轮查询中的有害关键词关系，并引入注意力感知增强机制。

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard有效提升了LLMs对多轮越狱攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeMul的新方法，通过直接蒸馏LLM知识到提示中，避免了传统方法中提取描述的不可靠性，提升了多提示学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过提取LLM的文本描述来增强提示，但存在高变异性和低可靠性问题，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出Description-free Multi-prompt Learning (DeMul)，直接蒸馏LLM知识到提示中，避免了描述提取过程，并采用多提示加权机制。

Result: 在11个识别数据集上取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过描述无关的多提示学习，显著提升了模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CGFM的新方法，通过结合辅助模型的输出和流匹配技术，提升了时间序列预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在局限性，如刚性源分布和有限采样路径，而流匹配技术提供了更快的生成和更高质量的输出。

Method: CGFM通过整合辅助模型的输出和历史数据，构建双面条件概率路径，并使用一般仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明，CGFM在性能上优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过利用辅助模型的错误信息和更灵活的概率路径，显著提升了时间序列预测的效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（RL）通常缺乏先验知识，而预训练模型能提供丰富的潜在表示。如何有效结合多个预训练模型的信息以提升RL性能仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 提出WSA架构，通过注意力机制结合多个预训练模型的嵌入信息，形成更丰富的状态表示。

Result: 在多个Atari游戏中，WSA表现与端到端模型相当，并研究了模型数量对性能的影响。

Conclusion: WSA有效结合预训练模型信息，为RL提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Result: 在仇恨言论检测领域的实证结果表明，DeCoLe在偏差感知的错误标记检测方面表现优异，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: DeCoLe为偏差感知的错误标记检测提供了有效解决方案，并可作为提升数据可靠性的工具应用于组织数据管理实践中。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Result: 学习到的奇异子空间在下游任务（如特征分析和多步预测）中可靠且有效。

Conclusion: 该方法在可扩展性和稳定性上优于现有方法，适用于随机动力系统。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Result: 在二元预测任务中，MUSE在校准和预测性能上优于单模型和简单集成基线。

Conclusion: MUSE通过利用模型多样性，提供更可靠的不确定性估计，适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型的规模和应用增长，注意力机制因其高内存和时间复杂度成为计算瓶颈，但缺乏对其实际能源使用和硬件需求的严格评估。

Method: 在GPT-2架构训练中，对八种注意力机制进行基准测试，测量训练时间、GPU内存使用、FLOPS、CPU使用和功耗等关键指标。

Result: 优化内核实现的注意力机制（如Flash Attention、LSH Attention和MLA）能效最佳，且仅降低GPU功耗并不能保证减少能源使用，训练时间同样重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了能源感知基准测试在注意力设计中的重要性，并为选择资源高效机制提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 分布式深度学习系统设计中亟需考虑中间特征泄露的安全问题。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Conclusion: 该研究首次展示了结合IMU和雷达数据的鲁棒多模态学习框架，为食物摄入检测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Result: 方法能够准确、可解释且可编辑地建模治疗动态，支持严格的因果分析和实际决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态治疗效果建模提供了新工具，兼具科学严谨性和临床实用性。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Result: 在模拟数据和实际应用中，TRIP测试能可靠检测置换特征重要性的不可靠性。

Conclusion: TRIP测试为置换特征重要性提供了可靠性验证，适用于高维数据。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Conclusion: Q-chunking为长时程稀疏奖励任务提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model
performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency, especially in
non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL
framework that integrates (i) a hybrid CNN-PQC architecture for expressive
decentralized learning, (ii) an adaptive accuracy-weighted aggregation scheme
leveraging differentially private validation accuracies, (iii) selective
homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces

TL;DR: 提出了一种安全且通信高效的集群联邦学习（CFL）设计，结合差分隐私（DP）技术，优化资源块分配和用户调度，并采用动态惩罚函数辅助的多智能体强化学习（DPVD-MARL）算法，显著提升收敛速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在异构基站和用户非独立同分布数据下，如何优化资源分配和用户调度以提升CFL性能的问题。

Method: 提出DPVD-MARL算法，动态分配惩罚函数，分布式优化资源块分配、用户调度和DP噪声。

Result: 仿真显示，DPVD-MARL比独立Q学习收敛速度快20%，累计奖励高15%。

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL能有效优化CFL性能，适用于异构环境下的联邦学习任务。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效保护协作训练中的信息安全，同时满足能耗和延迟约束。

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统性方法，通过微调LLM（Magistral Small模型）和创建双领域数据集，解决LLM在化学领域生成科学上合理但事实无效信息的“合理性-有效性差距”问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在专业领域（如化学）中常生成看似合理但事实错误的信息，这被称为“合理性-有效性差距”。本文旨在通过开发专业科学助手来弥补这一差距。

Method: 使用Magistral Small模型，通过LoRA微调，并创建双领域数据集（涵盖分子性质和化学反应），标准化数据以确保质量。

Result: 微调后的模型在格式一致性、分子化学有效性及合成路线可行性上显著优于基线模型，表现出层次学习模式（语法正确性优先于化学可能性）。与人类专家相比，模型在化学创造力和推理上表现竞争性，但仍存在立体化学错误、静态知识截止和偶尔的参考幻觉等问题。

Conclusion: 本文为将通用LLM转化为可靠的化学研究工具提供了可行框架，并指出了未来改进的关键领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Motivation: 传统图变换器将所有节点嵌入单一欧几里得空间，模糊了异构拓扑结构，需要更灵活的几何表示。

Method: 在现有图变换器前添加黎曼混合专家层，将节点路由到最适合其局部结构的流形（球形、平坦、双曲）。

Result: 在四个节点分类基准测试中，准确率提升高达3%。

Conclusion: 几何感知的投影方法不仅提高了预测能力，还使图表示更具解释性。

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Motivation: 尽管DRL在多个领域取得了成功，但其策略在不同参数评估环境中的泛化能力仍然有限。现有方法需要多样化的训练数据，但在实际应用中难以实现。

Method: 通过引入CEBE方程，提出了一种在单一上下文训练中近似多上下文Q函数的方法，并进一步开发了CSE作为数据增强技术。

Result: 理论和实验证明，CEBE能够提供多上下文Q函数的一阶近似，CSE在确定性控制环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: CEBE和CSE方法有效提升了DRL的泛化能力，尤其在数据有限的实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Result: 证明了正标记和无标记样本量的上下界。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了PU学习的理论框架，为更广泛的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Method: 通过变分下界估计器和基于Transformer的策略网络，结合归一化流变分后验，实现实时决策。

Result: 在多种因果推理和发现任务中，GO-CBED表现优于现有基线，尤其在实验预算有限和因果机制复杂的情况下。

Conclusion: GO-CBED展示了将实验设计目标与具体研究目标对齐的优势，以及前瞻性序列规划的重要性。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Result: 在391名患者的数据集上，分类性能显著提升（AUC提高13%，F1分数提高20%）。

Conclusion: ATHENA通过可解释AI驱动的子网络聚类，支持个性化干预策略，改善疾病预测和管理。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Motivation: 尽管基于人类偏好的奖励模型在强化学习框架（RLHF）中表现良好，但它们容易受到奖励攻击（reward hacking）的影响，尤其是在分布外场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种统一的奖励建模框架，联合训练基于Bradley-Terry（BT）的单目标奖励函数和基于回归的多目标奖励函数，共享嵌入空间。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分性能，7B模型甚至优于70B基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过联合训练单目标和多目标奖励函数，可以有效缓解奖励攻击问题，并提升模型在分布外场景中的表现。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Motivation: 由于分子动力学模拟难以直接观察罕见事件（如状态转变），现有机器学习方法在CV发现中未能完全编码详细动态信息。

Method: TLC通过建模时间滞后条件分布而非静态Boltzmann分布，学习CVs以捕捉慢动态行为，并在Alanine Dipeptide系统中验证。

Result: 在SMD和OPES任务中，TLC表现出与现有MLCV方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: TLC为CV发现提供了一种新方法，能更准确地捕捉动态行为，适用于增强采样任务。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental

Conclusion: HGMP通过多任务提示框架有效解决了异构图中的任务不匹配问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学科学面临数据多样、模糊且规模小的挑战，传统机器学习难以完全应对，而GPMs展现出解决这些问题的潜力。

Method: 综述了GPMs的基本构建原则及其在化学科学中的应用，包括未直接训练的任务和低数据量的灵活操作。

Result: 尽管许多应用仍处于原型阶段，但GPMs在化学科学中的应用前景广阔。

Conclusion: 随着对GPMs兴趣的增加，预计其应用将在未来几年成熟。

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

*Wooseong Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTME-MTL是一种动态令牌调制与扩展框架，通过识别令牌空间中的梯度冲突并自适应解决，提升多任务学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中任务间目标差异可能导致负迁移，现有预训练Transformer的固定结构和容量限制了适应性。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL框架，在令牌空间中动态识别梯度冲突并自适应调整，避免直接复制网络参数。

Result: 实验表明DTME-MTL能显著提升多任务性能，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为Transformer-based MTL提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

TL;DR: 比较了多种脑机接口分类器的不确定性量化能力，发现传统方法（CSP-LDA和MDRM-T）在不确定性估计上表现最佳，而深度学习方法（Deep Ensembles和CNN）在分类准确性上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究脑机接口分类器的不确定性量化能力，以提高分类的可靠性。

Method: 比较了传统方法（CSP-LDA和MDRM）与深度学习方法（Deep Ensembles、Direct Uncertainty Quantification和CNN）的不确定性量化能力。

Result: CSP-LDA和MDRM-T在不确定性估计上表现最佳，而深度学习方法在分类准确性上更优。所有模型都能区分难易样本。

Conclusion: 通过拒绝模糊样本可以提高分类准确性，传统方法在不确定性量化上优于深度学习方法。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCV结合PVGs和CBMs，提出了一种用于高维数据的可解释非线性分类框架，性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PVGs未应用于复杂高维数据，以及CBMs依赖低容量线性预测器的局限性。

Method: 利用概念发现模型提取结构化概念编码，通过非线性预测器进行决策。

Result: NCV在高维复杂数据集上优于CBM和像素基PVG分类器，并减少捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV是实现高性能、可验证AI的有前景的方法。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稳定分解的无逆正则化框架，解决了现有方法在神经网络中的数值不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因依赖显式Gram矩阵计算和逆运算导致数值不稳定，影响近似质量或产生奇异矩阵。

Method: 采用无逆正则化框架，基于稳定分解，解决了GPU内存不足、输入激活矩阵接近奇异和数据不足等问题。

Result: 方法在多种挑战性场景下表现稳定，证明了收敛性并推导了误差界限。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了数值稳定性，适用于大规模神经网络压缩和微调。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于元学习的新型框架，用于优化条件切换（CHO），在动态信号条件下性能优于3GPP基准180%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动网络复杂性增加，传统切换面临延迟和失败问题，条件切换（CHO）虽能缓解但引入新挑战，如资源分配和信令开销。

Method: 采用与O-RAN范式对齐的元学习框架，优化CHO的资源分配和信令管理。

Result: 在动态信号条件下，性能显著优于3GPP基准至少180%。

Conclusion: 提出的元学习框架有效解决了CHO的挑战，提升了切换性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于职业定义在不同企业和国家间存在差异，需要一种方法将O*NET数据库中的职业与其他定义进行映射。

Method: 采用BERT技术和多种聚类方法构建管道，结合降维技术，并使用专用轮廓方法优化结果。

Result: 通过降维和专用轮廓方法提升了聚类性能，实现了职业定义的自动区分。

Conclusion: 该方法为职业定义映射提供了新途径，可能帮助职业转型者找到新方向。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，SLOGAN显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过因果建模和动态干预实现了稳定的图表示迁移。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于EEG的深度学习模型在帕金森病检测中泛化能力差，主要由于受试者间的高变异性，因此需要开发更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 提出TransformEEG模型，采用深度卷积分词器生成通道特定特征，增强自注意力层的特征混合能力。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上，TransformEEG的中位数平衡准确率为78.45%，结合数据增强和阈值校正后提升至80.10%，变异性显著降低。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在帕金森病检测中表现更一致、可靠，优于其他现有模型。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Motivation: 在敏感领域中，协作机器学习需要可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。传统FL依赖中央服务器，存在单点故障和隐私风险，而SL因顺序训练扩展性差。

Method: 采用FSL与HLF结合的去中心化架构，利用HLF的瞬态字段和私有数据集合（PDCs）保护原始数据和模型激活，无需中央协调器。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise

Motivation: 理解随机ReLU层如何交替压缩和部分恢复输入变化的子空间，为深度网络表达能力的研究提供更细致的视角。

Method: 针对固定批次输入和随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并证明次高斯浓度边界。

Result: 期望秩赤字以几何比率衰减，复兴深度出现在特定位置，且秩振荡行为是有限宽度现象。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层通过交替压缩和部分恢复输入子空间，为深度网络表达能力提供了新的理解。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

Conclusion: FedCBDR有效解决了类不平衡问题，显著提升了联邦类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

*Tomu Hirata,Undral Byambadalai,Tatsushi Oka,Shota Yasui,Shingo Uto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种多任务神经网络方法，用于估计随机实验中的分布处理效应（DTE），解决了传统方法在数据不平衡和计算效率上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如ATE）无法提供细粒度的实验效果分析，且在处理大规模数据时存在精度和效率问题。

Method: 利用多任务神经网络估计条件结果分布，结合单调形状约束和多阈值标签学习以提高准确性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集（如节水实验和流媒体平台A/B测试）中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代因果推断应用提供了鲁棒且实用的解决方案，尤其适用于处理效应异质性分析。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的机器学习遗忘方法（OPC），通过深度特征遗忘解决现有方法浅层遗忘的问题，并验证了其对抗性能恢复和数据重建攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法仅通过调整模型响应实现浅层遗忘，内部表征仍保留被遗忘数据的信息，无法满足隐私、法律或伦理要求。

Method: 提出基于特征表示单点收缩的深度遗忘理论标准，并设计高效近似算法OPC。

Result: OPC在图像分类遗忘任务中表现出色，能有效对抗性能恢复和梯度反转攻击。

Conclusion: OPC的深度特征遗忘机制提升了遗忘方法的鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

*Tejaswini Medi,Steffen Jung,Margret Keuper*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIX是一种特征感知的对抗训练框架，通过自适应地为强类分配较弱的目标对抗样本，为弱类分配较强的无目标对抗样本，以减少类间鲁棒性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法对所有类别采用统一目标，忽略了类间脆弱性差异，导致强类更鲁棒而弱类更易受攻击。

Method: TRIX自适应地为强类分配弱目标对抗样本以促进特征多样性，为弱类分配强无目标对抗样本以增强其鲁棒性，并结合每类损失权重和扰动强度调整。

Result: 实验表明，TRIX显著提高了最差类别在干净和对抗数据上的准确率，减少了类间鲁棒性差异，同时保持了整体准确率。

Conclusion: TRIX是实现公平有效对抗防御的实用方法。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在目标域泛化中的挑战，特别是多任务下传统TTT方法的任务行为不同步问题。

Method: 提出S4T方法，通过预测跨域任务关系来同步多任务行为，并与传统TTT协议结合。

Result: S4T在多个基准测试中优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T有效解决了多任务下的域适应问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SAMVAE的多模态深度学习框架，用于生存分析，整合了六种数据模态，并在乳腺癌和低级别胶质瘤数据上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生存预测方法依赖单一数据模态，难以捕捉肿瘤生物学的复杂性，因此需要一种能够整合多模态数据的方法。

Method: 提出了SAMVAE框架，通过模态特定编码器将输入映射到共享潜在空间，支持生存预测和竞争风险场景分析。

Result: 在乳腺癌和低级别胶质瘤数据上，SAMVAE表现出色，性能优于现有方法，并能提供临床有意义的统计信息。

Conclusion: SAMVAE为肿瘤学中的生存分析提供了可解释、数据驱动的新方法，支持多模态数据整合和竞争风险建模。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Motivation: 研究自注意力块的Lipschitz性质，揭示其对Transformer鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 通过改进的softmax谱范数封闭表达式推导局部Lipschitz界，并提出JaSMin正则化项。

Result: 新界更准确，揭示了注意力分数图的影响，JaSMin提升了鲁棒性并降低了Lipschitz常数。

Conclusion: 新方法为理解Transformer鲁棒性提供了新视角，JaSMin是一种有效的正则化手段。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

Conclusion: 提出的不等式在协方差估计和动态系统学习中具有实际应用价值，改进了现有风险界限。

Abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses a
persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce
data-dependent Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in
Hilbert space. Our inequalities apply to both stationary and non-stationary
processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between
temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the
utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems,
achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Conclusion: 该研究为改进表格数据基础模型的基准测试迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Conclusion: 预训练模型的准确性对序列决策任务具有重要价值，模型弹性可作为评估和改进模型整合的基础指标。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Conclusion: 通过平方根参数化，成功建立了自然梯度变分高斯推断的收敛保证。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,

Conclusion: DPO的通用视角有助于理解其操作原理、扩展应用范围，并避免偏离理论框架的潜在问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Motivation: 抗菌素耐药性（AMR）加剧，现有方法无法快速识别有效分子对抗新病原体或耐药菌株。

Method: 结合分子特征和病原体特异性上下文，通过离散扩散语言模型和双嵌入框架整合基因组和文献数据。

Result: 在多种细菌和化学模式下表现优异，能可靠迁移至无抗菌数据的新病原体，并设计高效新分子。

Conclusion: ApexOracle为对抗AMR和未来传染病爆发提供了可扩展的策略。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

established simple heuristics for identifying high-quality co-folding

TL;DR: SAMO是一种轻量级的锐度感知多任务优化方法，通过全局-局部扰动结合解决多任务学习中的任务冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中任务冲突限制了模型性能，而锐度感知最小化（SAM）能缓解这一问题，但如何结合全局和局部信息以及降低计算开销是关键挑战。

Method: 提出SAMO方法，利用联合全局-局部扰动，通过仅前向传播近似局部扰动并进行层归一化以提高效率。

Result: 在多个多任务基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SAMO成功解决了任务冲突问题，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法通常在训练或编译时应用，依赖结构化稀疏性，未能充分利用无SIMD支持设备的细粒度效率。

Method: UnIT通过输入特定的激活模式动态识别并跳过不必要的乘加操作，将剪枝决策转化为轻量级比较，并优化计算。

Result: 在MSP430上，UnIT实现11.02%-82.03%的乘加操作减少，推理速度提升27.30%-84.19%，能耗降低27.33%-84.38%，精度损失仅0.48%-7%。

Conclusion: UnIT证明无结构推理时剪枝是一种可行且实用的解决方案，适用于MCU上的高效神经网络部署。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

traditional topic modeling techniques struggle to dynamically capture emerging
topics and their relationships. In this work, we propose an LLM-agent driven
approach to discover and retrieve emerging topics from quarterly earnings

into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）的进步引发了隐私、版权和数据管理的风险。现有技术通常依赖高资源和精心设计的提示词，本文旨在开发一种更简单、更普遍的攻击方法。

Method: 基于先前工作的直觉，利用领域知识，发现从电商平台抓取的数据存在模板化布局和图像与模式化提示词关联的漏洞。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了生成模型在数据隐私方面的潜在风险，强调了改进数据管理和模型设计的必要性。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

### [83] [Dynamic Chunking for End-to-End Hierarchical Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07955)
*Sukjun Hwang,Brandon Wang,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分块机制（H-Net），取代传统的分词-语言模型-去分词流程，实现真正的端到端学习。H-Net在性能和数据效率上优于基于分词的Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型仍依赖分词等预处理步骤，限制了端到端模型的潜力。论文旨在消除这一障碍，实现完全端到端的学习。

Method: 引入动态分块机制，结合分层网络（H-Net），自动学习内容和上下文相关的分段策略。

Result: H-Net在字节级别表现优于基于BPE分词的Transformer，多级分层进一步提升了性能和数据效率。在中文、代码和DNA序列等任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了端到端模型的潜力，尤其在数据效率和多语言、多模态任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PAC学习框架无法适应动态数据分布和目标变化，导致性能不佳，因此需要改进。

Method: 基于前瞻性学习框架，改进算法和数值结果，并将其扩展到顺序决策场景。

Result: 初步结果显示改进后的算法在动态环境中表现更优。

Conclusion: 前瞻性学习框架在动态和顺序决策场景中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

Result: 在微调预训练策略和利用离线数据训练在线的任务中，样本效率平均提高了2-3倍。

Conclusion: EXPO通过避免直接优化价值函数，实现了表达性策略的稳定训练，显著提升了样本效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态调整预训练大语言模型（LLM）架构的方法，通过跳过、重复或重新组合层来为每个测试样本定制更优的模型（CoLa）。使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）优化层组合，显著提升了推理效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练神经网络是否能在不微调的情况下动态调整架构以适应不同输入，并验证是否需要所有层来处理不同难度的任务。

Method: 提出链式层（CoLa）方法，通过跳过、重复或重新组合预训练模型的层，为每个样本定制动态架构。使用MCTS搜索最优层组合。

Result: 发现75%的正确预测样本可通过更短的CoLa提升效率，60%的错误预测样本可通过优化CoLa实现正确预测。

Conclusion: 固定架构的预训练LLM存在局限性，动态深度调整能显著提升推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Result: 认为‘涌现’和‘群体’的概念是主观的，更多取决于观察者的视角和隐性知识，而非系统本身。

Conclusion: 论文强调了群体行为生成过程的重要性，而非仅行为本身，为机器人群体系统的设计和部署提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Emergence and swarms are widely discussed topics, yet no consensus exists on
their formal definitions. This lack of agreement makes it difficult not only
for new researchers to grasp these concepts, but also for experts who may use
the same terms to mean different things. Many attempts have been made to
objectively define 'swarm' or 'emergence,' with recent work highlighting the
role of the external observer. Still, several researchers argue that once an
observer's vantage point (e.g., scope, resolution, context) is established, the
terms can be made objective or measured quantitatively. In this note, we
propose a framework to discuss these ideas rigorously by separating externally
observable states from latent, unobservable ones. This allows us to compare and
contrast existing definitions of swarms and emergence on common ground. We
argue that these concepts are ultimately subjective-shaped less by the system
itself than by the perception and tacit knowledge of the observer.
Specifically, we suggest that a 'swarm' is not defined by its group behavior
alone, but by the process generating that behavior. Our broader goal is to
support the design and deployment of robotic swarm systems, highlighting the
critical distinction between multi-robot systems and true swarms.

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

Abstract: Robotic dressing assistance has the potential to improve the quality of life
for individuals with limited mobility. Existing solutions predominantly rely on
rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable
garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior
robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control
strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and
adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the
Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth
mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the
SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method,
eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient
dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its
design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance.
The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various
garment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional
robotic dressing assistance.

Abstract: Navigation and inspection in confined environments, such as tunnels and
pipes, pose significant challenges for existing robots due to limitations in
maneuverability and adaptability to varying geometries. Vine robots, which are
soft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material
eversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate
tight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing
vine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways,
with branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine
robot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot
features a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine
robot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when
necessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip
steering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a
maximum steerable angle of 51.7{\deg}, (2) navigation of pipe networks with
radii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp
turns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using
tip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward
kinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe
system as well as a natural animal burrow.

Conclusion: LangNav和LangNavBench为语言导航任务提供了更全面的评估工具，MLFM方法在处理复杂语言指令时表现出色。

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部触觉反馈在手术机器人操作中遮挡直接交互的问题。

Method: 使用软气动手腕穿戴触觉设备，测试其在达芬奇手术机器人任务中对力施加准确性的影响。

Result: 提供手腕触觉反馈时，参与者施加的力误差显著降低，但操作时间延长。

Conclusion: 手腕触觉反馈有效，但可能影响操作速度与准确性的权衡。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can
improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of
teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However,
hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of
surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic
feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback
mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is
unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located
with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic
feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci
Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom
tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an
anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the
user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn
haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces.
Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when
wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the
palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic
feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to
operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.

TL;DR: UniTracker框架通过集成CVAE保留动作多样性，提升人形机器人控制的鲁棒性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于师生框架的方法在动作多样性和泛化能力上的不足。

Method: 利用CVAE显式建模人类动作的潜在多样性，结合学生策略。

Result: 在仿真和实际部署中显著优于MLP-based DAgger基线。

Conclusion: UniTracker为表达性人形控制提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid robots must achieve diverse, robust, and generalizable whole-body
control to operate effectively in complex, human-centric environments. However,
existing methods, particularly those based on teacher-student frameworks often
suffer from a loss of motion diversity during policy distillation and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen behaviors. In this work, we present
UniTracker, a simplified yet powerful framework that integrates a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) into the student policy to explicitly model the
latent diversity of human motion. By leveraging a learned CVAE prior, our
method enables the student to retain expressive motion characteristics while
improving robustness and adaptability under partial observations. The result is
a single policy capable of tracking a wide spectrum of whole-body motions with
high fidelity and stability. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world deployments demonstrate that UniTracker significantly outperforms
MLP-based DAgger baselines in motion quality, generalization to unseen
references, and deployment robustness, offering a practical and scalable
solution for expressive humanoid control.

TL;DR: PILOC框架通过局部感知和通信，结合信息素逆向引导机制，提升多智能体搜索与救援任务的效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态和未知环境中目标不可预测和环境不确定性对多智能体搜索与救援任务提出了挑战。

Method: 提出PILOC框架，利用局部感知和通信，引入信息素逆向引导机制，结合深度强化学习实现间接协调。

Result: 实验表明，PILOC在动态和通信受限场景下表现优于现有方法，显著提升搜索效率和系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PILOC为未来多智能体搜索与救援应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于自动驾驶运动规划模块的安全保障概念，通过引入时间保护机制，扩展了现有方法，确保系统响应的及时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中运动规划模块的功能安全性是关键挑战，尤其是在复杂或基于学习的软件中。在线验证是一种有前景的方法，但其在嵌入式实时环境中的集成仍有限。

Method: 提出了一个时间保护机制，监控规划输出的时间一致性，并结合约束可行性检查和基于成本的合理性评估，在实时操作系统上实现原型。

Result: 初步结果显示，安全保障模块在实时范围内运行，并能有效检测不安全轨迹。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个模块化、可扩展的运行时轨迹验证框架，并强调了在汽车级硬件上部署的关键方面。未来工作包括完善保护逻辑并通过硬件在环仿真和车辆测试验证其有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring the functional safety of motion planning modules in autonomous
vehicles remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with complex or
learning-based software. Online verification has emerged as a promising
approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded
real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding
concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time
safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility,
our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs
to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time
operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based
feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results
show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and
effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the
time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes
a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and
highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work
includes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness
through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing. The code is

Motivation: 解决GPS缺失环境下视觉惯性里程计（VIO）因漂移累积导致的定位误差问题。

Method: 结合基于证据学习的SCR姿态估计器和后退水平轨迹优化器，通过优化相机视角选择低不确定性像素，并融合SCR与IMU数据实现实时闭环。

Result: 仿真中，平移和旋转平均误差分别降低了54%/15%和40%/31%；硬件在环实验验证了框架的可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效减少了定位误差，适用于GPS缺失环境中的自主飞行。

Abstract: Autonomous flight in GPS denied indoor spaces requires trajectories that keep
visual localization error tightly bounded across varied missions. Whereas
visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate
regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We
present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based
SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer
steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable
scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream
with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In
simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15%
(40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively.
Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our
proposed framework.

Abstract: The applications of fingertip haptic devices have spread to various fields

this work, we present FiDTouch, a 3D wearable haptic device that delivers
cutaneous stimuli to the finger pad, such as contact, pressure, encounter, skin
stretch, and vibrotactile feedback. The application of a tiny inverted Delta
robot in the mechanism design allows providing accurate contact and fast
changing dynamic stimuli to the finger pad surface. The performance of the
developed display was evaluated in a two-stage user study of the perception of
static spatial contact stimuli and skin stretch stimuli generated on the finger
pad. The proposed display, by providing users with precise touch and force
stimuli, can enhance user immersion and efficiency in the fields of
human-computer and human-robot interactions.

Motivation: 在CDPRs的负载操纵任务中，需在固定姿态下检测异常以确保安全，但传统方法依赖额外传感器。本文旨在探索仅用电机扭矩数据的可行性。

Method: 通过短时间校准拟合GMM，实时使用马氏距离评估扭矩信号，动态更新模型参数以适应环境变化。

Result: 在14次长时测试中，方法实现了100%真阳性率和95.4%平均真阴性率，检测延迟仅1秒。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外传感器，对漂移和环境变化具有更高鲁棒性，优于功率阈值和非自适应GMM方法。

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

introduction of high-level haptic interfaces for robotic assistance that aim at

execution of each training exercise.An experimental study shows that the
introduction of enhanced robotic assistance into a surgical robotics training
curriculum improves performance during the training process and, crucially,
promotes the transfer of the acquired skills to an unassisted surgical
scenario, like the clinical one.

Abstract: Robot swarms offer the potential to serve a variety of distributed sensing
applications. An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit
significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where
traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their
static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of
miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural
damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In
particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize
finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration
data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic
simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting
robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots'
exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii)
operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and
comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the
influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the
effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number,
locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation
studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for
vibration-based structural inspection.

Conclusion: LLMs在动作分类和分割任务中展现出潜力，为实际场景提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their recent introduction to human society, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have significantly affected the way we tackle mental challenges in our
everyday lives. From optimizing our linguistic communication to assisting us in
making important decisions, LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are notably reducing our
cognitive load by gradually taking on an increasing share of our mental
activities. In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and
segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling,
twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this
work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task,
considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking
operations. By utilizing LLMs instead of simple supervised learning or analytic
methods, we aim at making the method easily applicable and deployable in a
real-life scenario. Three different fine-tuning approaches are investigated,
compared on datasets captured kinesthetically, using a UR10e robot, during a
fruit-picking scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM系统在动态物体、低纹理和光照变化下性能下降，需要一种更鲁棒的前端处理方法。

Method: 提出IRAF-SLAM，包含图像增强、自适应特征提取和特征筛选策略。

Result: 在TUM-VI和EuRoC数据集上表现优于现有方法，减少了跟踪失败并提高了精度。

Conclusion: 自适应前端策略能有效提升SLAM鲁棒性，且计算开销低。

Abstract: Robust Visual SLAM (vSLAM) is essential for autonomous systems operating in
real-world environments, where challenges such as dynamic objects, low texture,
and critically, varying illumination conditions often degrade performance.
Existing feature-based SLAM systems rely on fixed front-end parameters, making
them vulnerable to sudden lighting changes and unstable feature tracking. To
address these challenges, we propose ``IRAF-SLAM'', an Illumination-Robust and
Adaptive Feature-Culling front-end designed to enhance vSLAM resilience in
complex and challenging environments. Our approach introduces: (1) an image
enhancement scheme to preprocess and adjust image quality under varying
lighting conditions; (2) an adaptive feature extraction mechanism that
dynamically adjusts detection sensitivity based on image entropy, pixel
intensity, and gradient analysis; and (3) a feature culling strategy that
filters out unreliable feature points using density distribution analysis and a
lighting impact factor. Comprehensive evaluations on the TUM-VI and European
Robotics Challenge (EuRoC) datasets demonstrate that IRAF-SLAM significantly
reduces tracking failures and achieves superior trajectory accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art vSLAM methods under adverse illumination conditions. These
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive front-end strategies in
improving vSLAM robustness without incurring significant computational
overhead. The implementation of IRAF-SLAM is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该系统通过人机协作和OTS实现了高精度的MASO手术，减少了对外科医生经验的依赖。

Abstract: Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO) is a significant procedure in oral
and maxillofacial surgery. Despite advances in technique and instrumentation,
its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a
human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a
preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition
methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three
subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the
robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to
ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a
skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the
patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a
dental occlusal splint. A registration method and Robot-OTS calibration method
are introduced to achieve reliable navigation within our framework. The
experiments of drilling were conducted on the realistic phantom model, which
demonstrated that the average error between the planned and actual drilling
points is 1.85mm.

Abstract: Unknown dynamic load carrying is one important practical application for
quadruped robots. Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges
in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics
of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the
dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to
interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this
work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics
modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed
modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL)
based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load
movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the
sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios. We
conduct extensive comparative simulation experiments to validate the
effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Results show that our
method outperforms other methods in sudden load resistance, load stabilizing
and locomotion with heavy load on rough terrain.

Abstract: Autonomous agents, particularly in the field of robotics, rely on sensory
information to perceive and navigate their environment. However, these sensory
inputs are often imperfect, leading to distortions in the agent's internal
representation of the world. This paper investigates the nature of these
perceptual distortions and how they influence autonomous representation
learning using a minimal robotic system. We utilize a simulated two-wheeled
robot equipped with distance sensors and a compass, operating within a simple
square environment. Through analysis of the robot's sensor data during random
exploration, we demonstrate how a distorted perceptual space emerges. Despite
these distortions, we identify emergent structures within the perceptual space
that correlate with the physical environment, revealing how the robot
autonomously learns a structured representation for navigation without explicit
spatial information. This work contributes to the understanding of embodied
cognition, minimal agency, and the role of perception in self-generated
navigation strategies in artificial life.

Abstract: As the robotics systems increasingly integrate into daily life, from smart
home assistants to the new-wave of industrial automation systems (Industry
4.0), there's an increasing need to bridge the gap between complex robotic
systems and everyday users. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible
framework often utilised in writing robot software, providing tools and
libraries for building complex robotic systems. However, ROS's distributed
architecture and technical messaging system create barriers for understanding
robot status and diagnosing errors. This gap can lead to extended maintenance
downtimes, as users with limited ROS knowledge may struggle to quickly diagnose
and resolve system issues. Moreover, this deficit in expertise often delays
proactive maintenance and troubleshooting, further increasing the frequency and
duration of system interruptions. ROS Help Desk provides intuitive error
explanations and debugging support, dynamically customized to users of varying
expertise levels. It features user-centric debugging tools that simplify error
diagnosis, implements proactive error detection capabilities to reduce
downtime, and integrates multimodal data processing for comprehensive system
state understanding across multi-sensor data (e.g., lidar, RGB). Testing
qualitatively and quantitatively with artificially induced errors demonstrates
the system's ability to proactively and accurately diagnose problems,
ultimately reducing maintenance time and fostering more effective human-robot
collaboration.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人为标注，存在主观性和偏差，需要更客观的分类方法以提高AEBS验证的可靠性。

Method: 采用基于预测分歧原则（PDP）的规则分类方法，分析AEBS的激活情况，并结合人为标注以提高分类效果。

Result: 该方法展示了其优势和局限性，并提出了系统实现的关键要求，表明结合人为标注可提升分类的透明度和一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为AEBS验证提供了更可靠和可重复的框架，未来可进一步优化和扩展应用范围。

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

such as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body
touch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not
require the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot
equipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to
democratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers
to provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our
approach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On
Franka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can
localize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU
without adding any additional sensors to the robot. Project website:
