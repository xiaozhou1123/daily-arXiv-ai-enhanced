In contrast, humans learn these properties through\ninteractive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and\ntactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)\nrepresentation for active perception of object properties. While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the\nreal-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot\nmanipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile\nsensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector.

However, the high deformability of soft\ntissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,\nmeshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the\nintegration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a\nmore immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a\nconditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model\ntakes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically\ndesigned to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on\nthem. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of\na soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity\nby initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with\nthe experimental data.

Using SuperPoint and\nSuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an\niterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through\nstep-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.\nExperimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves\naverage positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,\nboulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly\noutperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB\ninput.

While existing research has primarily\nconcentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter\nregularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT\nremains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT\ninherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to\nmulti-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit\nregularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.\nFinally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the\nstability and efficiency of RFT.

In addition to observational data, the\ntraining dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted\ninterventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust\nagainst the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches\ntreat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying\ncausal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from\nthese interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal\nrelational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations\nthat produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and\ninterventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training\nsamples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation\nbetween this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the\nindependence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For\nlinear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of\ninterventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional\nindependence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and\nits non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data.

In the\nabsence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from\nthe available observational data. However, observational data are often\ncompatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single\nstructure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural\nuncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior\ndistribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.\nUnfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with\nthe number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose\nto circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end\nmodel: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process\n(MACE-TNP).

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs.

Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical\nsuccess across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the\ngeneralization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring\neither graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the\nfirst learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping\nconnections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ngeneralization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest\nachievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the\nproposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification\nmaintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges\nthat support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections\nlead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a\ntwo-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified\nmatrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer.

First, hyperparameter tuning is often\nimpractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model\nrobustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly\nfrom training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training\nmultiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a\nhigher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any\nindividual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained\nwith diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied\nindividual performance.

Despite their strong\nperformance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant\nreasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon\nraises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model\nautonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without\nexternal labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding\n(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free\nself-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance\nmetacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency.
