Each ambiguous obstacle may be\ndisambiguated at a (possibly) heterogeneous resource cost, subject to a global\ndisambiguation budget. We formulate this constrained planning problem as a\nWeight-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (WCSPP) with risk-adjusted edge costs\nthat incorporate probabilistic blockage and traversal penalties. To solve it,\nwe propose a novel algorithmic framework-COLOGR-combining Lagrangian relaxation\nwith a two-phase vertex elimination (TPVE) procedure. The method prunes\ninfeasible and suboptimal paths while provably preserving the optimal solution,\nand leverages dual bounds to guide efficient search. We establish correctness,\nfeasibility guarantees, and surrogate optimality under mild assumptions. Our\nanalysis also demonstrates that COLOGR frequently achieves zero duality gap and\noffers improved computational complexity over prior constrained path-planning\nmethods.

Recently, several studies\nhighlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the\ngeneralization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a\nseries of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the\ngeneralization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from\ntopological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds\nrely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in\nspecific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),\npotentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we\nseek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization\nbounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce\na novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies\nvia proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing\nnotion of \\textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \\textit{trajectory stability},\nwe prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be\nupper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the\ntrajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory\nstability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental\nevaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great\nimportance, especially as the number of training samples grows.

One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels.

Unlike previous\nEHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of\nexpert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we\nintroduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series\nEHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and\ncompression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal\ndynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework\nfor multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional\nsimilarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.\nValidated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models\nin fidelity and utility. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/eunbyeol-cho/RawMed."}

To address this limitation, we\npropose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings\nfrom pretrained protein language models.

However, existing semantic\ncaching frameworks rely on single embedding models for query representation,\nwhich limits their ability to capture the diverse semantic relationships\npresent in real-world query distributions. This paper presents an ensemble\nembedding approach that combines multiple embedding models through a trained\nmeta-encoder to improve semantic similarity detection in LLM caching systems.\nWe evaluate our method using the Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, measuring\ncache hit ratios, cache miss ratios, token savings, and response times.

DIL faces two critical challenges in the\ncontext of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class\ndistribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,\nas intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while\ncross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and\ntransferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts\n(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert\nis guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific\nfrequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.\nSubsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing\npseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class\nstatistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot\nknowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class\nperformance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance."}

While it is common to decrease the learning rate for smaller batch sizes,\nother hyperparameters are often held fixed. In this work, we revisit small\nbatch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for\nscaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. We find that small batch\nsizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to hyperparameter\nchoices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than larger batch\nsizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with vanilla SGD,\neven without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state.

The dominant machine\nlearning paradigm is built on the premise that scaling data and model sizes\nwill improve out-of-distribution performance, including compositional\ngeneralization. We test this premise through controlled experiments that\nsystematically vary data scale, concept diversity, and combination coverage. We\nfind that compositional generalization is driven by data diversity, not mere\ndata scale. Increased combinatorial coverage forces models to discover a\nlinearly factored representational structure, where concepts decompose into\nadditive components. We prove this structure is key to efficiency, enabling\nperfect generalization from few observed combinations. Evaluating pretrained\nmodels (DINO, CLIP), we find above-random yet imperfect performance, suggesting\npartial presence of this structure.
