The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of two\ncore post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge\nretention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.

(2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely.

Throughout extensive\nexperiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity\nproves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer\nfrom diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)\nmulti-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment\ntransfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently\ntransfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during\nfine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,\narising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in\nhuman demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity\nmultimodality emerging as a key contributing factor.

This paper presents the\nfirst learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping\nconnections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ngeneralization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest\nachievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the\nproposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification\nmaintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges\nthat support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections\nlead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a\ntwo-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified\nmatrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer.

Despite their strong\nperformance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant\nreasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon\nraises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model\nautonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without\nexternal labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding\n(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free\nself-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance\nmetacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the\ngeometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant\nreasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to\nrepetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we\nfurther introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,\nCoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to\nterminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B\ndemonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%\nwhile improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the\nchallenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model."}

Existing\nmethods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy\nrobustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe\npractice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that\nprioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)\ndetection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target\ndomain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and\nincorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for\ndiverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty\nregions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust\ngeneralization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We\nevaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced\nsample efficiency compared to baselines."}

While most existing methods rely on\nfirst-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information\ncan, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost\nof function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits\npractical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian\n(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these\ncosts by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each\nsubspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the\nobjective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further\nreduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching\nstrategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.\nExperiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep\nneural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly\nfaster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods."}
