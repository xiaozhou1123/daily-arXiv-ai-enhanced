TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于4通道双边控制的力反馈远程操作方法，适用于低成本机械臂，并通过实验验证其在快速或接触丰富任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有远程操作系统多为单边控制，缺乏力反馈，难以应对快速或接触丰富的任务。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用4通道双边控制，结合非线性补偿、速度和外力估计以及惯性变化的可变增益，实现力反馈远程操作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在快速和接触丰富的任务中表现优异，且将力信息纳入模仿学习的输入输出可提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本机械臂的高保真远程操作和数据收集提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

TL;DR: 本文通过扩展Diffusion Policy范式，在多任务机器人操纵策略（LBMs）上进行了严格评估，验证了多任务预训练能提升策略的成功率和鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 评估大规模机器人基础模型的真实性能是当前研究的挑战，本文旨在通过严谨的评估方法填补这一空白。

Method: 采用Diffusion Policy范式，结合模拟和真实世界数据，设计评估管道进行统计验证，并与单任务基线进行对比。

Conclusion: 多任务预训练是提升机器人操纵策略的有效方法，未来可进一步扩展其应用。

Abstract: Robot manipulation has seen tremendous progress in recent years, with
imitation learning policies enabling successful performance of dexterous and
hard-to-model tasks. Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the
development of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating
large-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While
these models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful
evaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the
pace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current
capabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot
manipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by
extending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and
real-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to
rigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical
confidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized
trials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world
experiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more
successful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,
using a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,
performance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决海洋机器人中的立体声学数据融合问题，提出一种适用于跨模态声纳的几何投影方法。

Method: 受立体相机极线几何启发，利用相对姿态信息将特征从一个声纳图像投影到另一个声纳图像。

Result: 通过仿真确定了适用于野外机器人应用的理想立体配置，如特征对应和3D信息恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态声纳数据融合提供了有效解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we address stereo acoustic data fusion for marine robotics and
propose a geometry-based method for projecting observed features from one sonar
to another for a cross-modal stereo sonar setup that consists of both a
forward-looking and a sidescan sonar. Our acoustic geometry for sidescan and
forward-looking sonar is inspired by the epipolar geometry for stereo cameras,
and we leverage relative pose information to project where an observed feature
in one sonar image will be found in the image of another sonar. Additionally,
we analyze how both the feature location relative to the sonar and the relative
pose between the two sonars impact the projection. From simulated results, we
identify desirable stereo configurations for applications in field robotics
like feature correspondence and recovery of the 3D information of the feature.

### [4] [CRED: Counterfactual Reasoning and Environment Design for Active Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05458)
*Yi-Shiuan Tung,Bradley Hayes,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRED是一种用于主动偏好学习（APL）的轨迹生成方法，通过联合优化环境设计和轨迹选择，提高奖励估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要适应人类偏好（如距离、时间和安全的平衡），但现有APL方法在长时任务中难以探索完整轨迹空间和识别信息丰富的查询。

Method: CRED通过环境设计“想象”新场景，并利用反事实推理生成多样且信息丰富的轨迹用于排序。

Result: 在GridWorld和OpenStreetMap导航实验中，CRED提高了奖励学习效果，并能有效泛化到不同环境。

Conclusion: CRED通过优化轨迹生成和环境设计，显著提升了APL在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: For effective real-world deployment, robots should adapt to human
preferences, such as balancing distance, time, and safety in delivery routing.
Active preference learning (APL) learns human reward functions by presenting
trajectories for ranking. However, existing methods often struggle to explore
the full trajectory space and fail to identify informative queries,
particularly in long-horizon tasks. We propose CRED, a trajectory generation
method for APL that improves reward estimation by jointly optimizing
environment design and trajectory selection. CRED "imagines" new scenarios
through environment design and uses counterfactual reasoning -- by sampling
rewards from its current belief and asking "What if this reward were the true
preference?" -- to generate a diverse and informative set of trajectories for
ranking. Experiments in GridWorld and real-world navigation using OpenStreetMap
data show that CRED improves reward learning and generalizes effectively across
different environments.

### [5] [Gaussian Process-Based Active Exploration Strategies in Vision and Touch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05522)
*Ho Jin Choi,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合视觉和触觉的GPDF表示方法，用于主动感知物体属性，无需大量预训练数据，并通过多传感器不确定性量化优化探索动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人因缺乏先验知识难以理解物体属性（如形状、材料），而人类通过多感官交互学习。本文旨在通过多模态融合提升机器人对物体属性的感知能力。

Method: 提出GPDF表示，结合点云、梯度、Hessian和表面不确定性估计，通过视觉初始估计和触觉测量迭代优化几何形状，并利用不确定性规划探索动作。

Result: 实验使用Franka Research 3机器人，成功探索静态物体的形状和属性，展示了GPDF在几何建模及潜在扩展能力。

Conclusion: GPDF通过多模态融合和主动探索，有效提升了机器人对复杂物体几何的感知能力，并具备扩展到非几何属性的潜力。

Abstract: Robots struggle to understand object properties like shape, material, and
semantics due to limited prior knowledge, hindering manipulation in
unstructured environments. In contrast, humans learn these properties through
interactive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and
tactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)
representation for active perception of object properties. While primarily
focusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling
surface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using
point cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,
which are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By
utilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need
extensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by
aggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework
iteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using
differentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.
By quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to
maximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the
real-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot
manipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile
sensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In
these experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects
assumed to be static and placed on the table. To improve scalability, we
investigate approximation methods like inducing point method for Gaussian
Processes. This probabilistic multi-modal fusion enables active exploration and
mapping of complex object geometries, extending potentially beyond geometry.

Abstract: We introduce PAPRLE (Plug-And-Play Robotic Limb Environment), a modular
ecosystem that enables flexible placement and control of robotic limbs. With
PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control
them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming
controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of
teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task
requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable
puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target
robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these
puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot.
By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides
real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction
awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements
of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research
in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various
real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations
of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open
source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader
adoption and community-driven extension. Additional resources and

### [7] [Structured Task Solving via Modular Embodied Intelligence: A Case Study on Rubik's Cube](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05607)
*Chongshan Fan,Shenghai Yuan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Auto-RubikAI是一个模块化自主规划框架，结合知识库、视觉语言模型和大语言模型，以最小数据需求解决结构化操作任务（如魔方还原）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人系统依赖预定义脚本或大规模演示数据，Auto-RubikAI旨在实现可解释的多步任务执行，无需先验演示。

Method: 系统采用知识库模块解决符号推理问题，视觉语言模型解析RGB-D输入构建3D场景，大语言模型生成结构化控制代码。

Result: 实验显示79%的任务成功率，相比基线方法减少了平均解决步骤，同时保持可解释性和安全性。

Conclusion: Auto-RubikAI为智能制造和机器人教育提供了高效、模块化的任务规划基础。

Abstract: This paper presents Auto-RubikAI, a modular autonomous planning framework
that integrates a symbolic Knowledge Base (KB), a vision-language model (VLM),
and a large language model (LLM) to solve structured manipulation tasks
exemplified by Rubik's Cube restoration. Unlike traditional robot systems based
on predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and
large-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step
task execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The
proposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps,
overcoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to
construct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates
structured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module
architecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy
Auto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic
arm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining.
Experiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized
configurations. Compared to CFOP, DeepCubeA, and Two-Phase baselines, our
KB-enhanced method reduces average solution steps while maintaining
interpretability and safety. Auto-RubikAI provides a cost-efficient, modular
foundation for embodied task planning in smart manufacturing, robotics
education, and autonomous execution scenarios. Code, prompts, and hardware
modules will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamGrasp利用预训练图像生成模型的想象力推断场景未观察部分，结合3D重建和对比学习，实现复杂环境下的鲁棒3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏RGB图像下3D几何重建和物体识别的挑战，特别是在遮挡和杂乱的真实场景中。

Method: 结合粗粒度3D重建、对比学习的实例分割和文本引导的实例级细化。

Result: 实验表明DreamGrasp能准确恢复物体几何，并支持下游任务如顺序清理和目标检索。

Conclusion: DreamGrasp克服了现有方法的局限性，适用于复杂多物体环境。

Abstract: Partial-view 3D recognition -- reconstructing 3D geometry and identifying
object instances from a few sparse RGB images -- is an exceptionally
challenging yet practically essential task, particularly in cluttered, occluded
real-world settings where full-view or reliable depth data are often
unavailable. Existing methods, whether based on strong symmetry priors or
supervised learning on curated datasets, fail to generalize to such scenarios.
In this work, we introduce DreamGrasp, a framework that leverages the
imagination capability of large-scale pre-trained image generative models to
infer the unobserved parts of a scene. By combining coarse 3D reconstruction,
instance segmentation via contrastive learning, and text-guided instance-wise
refinement, DreamGrasp circumvents limitations of prior methods and enables
robust 3D reconstruction in complex, multi-object environments. Our experiments
show that DreamGrasp not only recovers accurate object geometry but also
supports downstream tasks like sequential decluttering and target retrieval
with high success rates.

TL;DR: Chrono::CRM是一种基于物理的通用、可扩展且高效的模拟解决方案，用于解决土壤力学问题，支持复杂任务如挖掘和与可变形车轮的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越半经验土壤力学方法（如Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto），提供基于物理的模型以处理复杂任务。

Method: 基于Chrono的SPH框架，结合GPU加速和“活动域”实现，支持大规模地形模拟。

Result: 验证了实验数据和高保真DEM模拟，计算效率接近半经验方法，支持10公里地形和1亿SPH粒子。

Conclusion: Chrono::CRM作为开源工具，为大规模高保真越野模拟提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein
Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution
for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics
approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model
able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction
with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics
model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid
and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate
Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one
involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against
a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario
involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR).
Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable
to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems.
Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain
stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive
rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a
component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released
under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are
available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further
research.

*Haitao Lu,Haijier Chen,Haoze Liu,Shoujian Zhang,Bo Xu,Ziao Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅的大规模重定位框架3DGS-LSR，仅需单目RGB图像即可实现厘米级定位，适用于复杂城市环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂城市环境中GNSS定位不可靠及传统地图方法存储和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 结合多传感器数据构建高精度3DGS地图，利用SuperPoint和SuperGlue进行特征提取与匹配，通过迭代优化策略逐步优化定位结果。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，3DGS-LSR在城镇道路、林荫大道和交通密集高速路上的平均定位精度分别为0.026m、0.029m和0.081m，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS-LSR为自主机器人在GNSS失效的复杂城市环境中提供了可靠的定位能力。

Abstract: In autonomous robotic systems, precise localization is a prerequisite for
safe navigation. However, in complex urban environments, GNSS positioning often
suffers from signal occlusion and multipath effects, leading to unreliable
absolute positioning. Traditional mapping approaches are constrained by storage
requirements and computational inefficiency, limiting their applicability to
resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address these challenges, we propose
3DGS-LSR: a large-scale relocalization framework leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling centimeter-level positioning using only a single
monocular RGB image on the client side. We combine multi-sensor data to
construct high-accuracy 3DGS maps in large outdoor scenes, while the robot-side
localization requires just a standard camera input. Using SuperPoint and
SuperGlue for feature extraction and matching, our core innovation is an
iterative optimization strategy that refines localization results through
step-by-step rendering, making it suitable for real-time autonomous navigation.
Experimental validation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates our 3DGS-LSR achieves
average positioning accuracies of 0.026m, 0.029m, and 0.081m in town roads,
boulevard roads, and traffic-dense highways respectively, significantly
outperforming other representative methods while requiring only monocular RGB
input. This approach provides autonomous robots with reliable localization
capabilities even in challenging urban environments where GNSS fails.

*Neelay Joglekar,Fei Liu,Florian Richter,Michael C. Yip*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种稳定的跟踪闭环控制器，解决了RCM机械臂在视野外部分的运动控制问题，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCM机械臂在微创手术中至关重要，但关节读数误差会影响控制精度，尤其是视野外的误差无法通过视觉校正。

Method: 设计了稳定的跟踪闭环控制器，并将其整合到双层控制方案中，用于整个运动链。

Result: 在仿真和实际环境中验证了控制器的稳定性和有效性。

Conclusion: 为从远程操作向自主手术过渡提供了关键技术支持。

Abstract: Remote Center of Motion (RCM) robotic manipulators have revolutionized
Minimally Invasive Surgery, enabling precise, dexterous surgical manipulation
within the patient's body cavity without disturbing the insertion point on the
patient. Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous
subtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic
surgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes.
However, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading
errors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control.
Although visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view
joints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are
irreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized
the stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing
a provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion
of the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this
controller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We
rigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify
our theoretical findings. Our work provides key insights into the next steps
required for the transition from teleoperated to autonomous surgery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习在机器人领域表现出强大能力，但在足式运动中的应用较少，主要由于稳定性问题和有限数据下的任务转换困难。

Method: 通过扩散模型进行多任务预训练，再结合PPO在线微调，使用DDIM高效采样和TensorRT优化部署。

Conclusion: DMLoco提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，适用于足式机器人的语言条件控制。

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the powerful capabilities of imitation
learning in robotics. Leveraging generative models, particularly diffusion
models, these approaches offer notable advantages such as strong multi-task
generalization, effective language conditioning, and high sample efficiency.
While their application has been successful in manipulation tasks, their use in
legged locomotion remains relatively underexplored, mainly due to compounding
errors that affect stability and difficulties in task transition under limited
data. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results in
legged robot control in the past years, providing valuable insights to address
these challenges. In this work, we propose DMLoco, a diffusion-based framework
for quadruped robots that integrates multi-task pretraining with online PPO
finetuning to enable language-conditioned control and robust task transitions.
Our approach first pretrains the policy on a diverse multi-task dataset using
diffusion models, enabling language-guided execution of various skills. Then,
it finetunes the policy in simulation to ensure robustness and stable task
transition during real-world deployment. By utilizing Denoising Diffusion
Implicit Models (DDIM) for efficient sampling and TensorRT for optimized
deployment, our policy runs onboard at 50Hz, offering a scalable and efficient
solution for adaptive, language-guided locomotion on resource-constrained
robotic platforms.

TL;DR: 论文提出hPGA-DP，一种结合Projective Geometric Algebra（PGA）的扩散策略方法，通过几何归纳偏置提高机器人学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在机器人学习中受欢迎，但每次训练需重新学习空间表示，效率低。引入几何归纳偏置可解决此问题。

Method: 提出hPGA-DP，结合PGA和P-GATr（E(3)-等变性质），采用混合架构（U-Net或Transformer）进行去噪。

Result: 实验表明hPGA-DP提高了任务性能和训练效率，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: hPGA-DP通过几何偏置和混合架构显著提升了扩散策略的效果。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to
their reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these
policies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones,
conditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a
robotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations
and operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to
ground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating
geometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this
redundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical
framework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric
inductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it
provides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric
primitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks
to reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable
operations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that
incorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging
its E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts
a hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action
decoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising
process. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and
real-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task
performance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but
also achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model
compared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖神经网络感知，但其不确定性可能导致安全风险，需要一种能动态适应感知置信度的安全规划方法。

Method: 结合DRO和EDL，提出基于证据分布的模糊集，并将其集成到模型预测控制（MPC）中，形成DRO-EDL-MPC算法。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中验证，高感知置信度下保持效率，低置信度下强制保守约束。

Conclusion: DRO-EDL-MPC框架有效平衡了自动驾驶的安全性和效率，动态适应感知不确定性。

Abstract: Safety is a critical concern in motion planning for autonomous vehicles.
Modern autonomous vehicles rely on neural network-based perception, but making
control decisions based on these inference results poses significant safety
risks due to inherent uncertainties. To address this challenge, we present a
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that accounts for both
aleatoric and epistemic perception uncertainties using evidential deep learning
(EDL). Our approach introduces a novel ambiguity set formulation based on
evidential distributions that dynamically adjusts the conservativeness
according to perception confidence levels. We integrate this uncertainty-aware
constraint into model predictive control (MPC), proposing the DRO-EDL-MPC
algorithm with computational tractability for autonomous driving applications.
Validation in the CARLA simulator demonstrates that our approach maintains
efficiency under high perception confidence while enforcing conservative
constraints under low confidence.

Abstract: High fidelity estimation algorithms for robotics require accurate data.
However, timestamping of sensor data is a key issue that rarely receives the
attention it deserves. Inaccurate timestamping can be compensated for in
post-processing but is imperative for online estimation. Simultaneously, even
online mitigation of timing issues can be achieved through a relaxation of the
tuning parameters from their otherwise more performative optimal values, but at
a detriment to performance. To address the need for real-time, low-cost
timestamping, a versatile system which utilizes readily-available components
and established methods for synchronization is introduced. The synchronization
and triggering (of both high- and low-rate sensors) capabilities of the system
are demonstrated.

Result: 在8字形参考路径上的仿真表明，框架能实现平滑稳定的惯性漂移。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了惯性漂移中的控制问题，提升了自动驾驶赛车的性能。

Abstract: Inertia drift is a transitional maneuver between two sustained drift stages
in opposite directions, which provides valuable insights for navigating
consecutive sharp corners for autonomous racing.However, this can be a
challenging scenario for the drift controller to handle rapid transitions
between opposing sideslip angles while maintaining accurate path tracking.
Moreover, accurate drift control depends on a high-fidelity vehicle model to
derive drift equilibrium points and predict vehicle states, but this is often
compromised by the strongly coupled longitudinal-lateral drift dynamics and
unpredictable environmental variations. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a learning-based planning and control framework utilizing Bayesian
optimization (BO), which develops a planning logic to ensure a smooth
transition and minimal velocity loss between inertia and sustained drift
phases. BO is further employed to learn a performance-driven control policy
that mitigates modeling errors for enhanced system performance. Simulation
results on an 8-shape reference path demonstrate that the proposed framework
can achieve smooth and stable inertia drift through sharp corners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统难以理解交通语义信息和参与者意图，导致决策与熟练驾驶员不一致。

Method: LeAD整合了高频端到端子系统和低频LLM模块，通过多模态感知融合和链式推理优化决策。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中，LeAD在Leaderboard V1基准测试中得分71，路线完成率达93%。

Conclusion: LeAD在非常规场景中表现优异，为大规模城市自动驾驶部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional
scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route
completion of 93%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决抓取姿态检测（GPD）在联邦学习中因大模型通信开销高而难以应用的问题。

Method: 通过分析模型模块的学习动态，识别收敛慢的模块，并分两阶段训练：全模型训练和仅训练慢收敛模块的高效通信阶段。

Result: 在GraspNet-1B数据集和真实机器人实验中，方法优于FedAvg等基线，通信效率更高且抓取成功率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架在通信成本和模型性能间取得了更好的平衡，适用于去中心化训练鲁棒的GPD模型。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Method: 在2D和3D道路网络上测试A*、Dijkstra、RRT*和NIACO算法，使用卫星和LiDAR数据，评估路径成本、计算时间和内存消耗。

Result: Dijkstra算法在2D和3D场景中表现最稳定高效，尤其适用于密集的像素级地理空间道路图。

Conclusion: Dijkstra算法在静态地形导航中可靠，为未来动态路径规划研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on
dynamic path planning under complex environmental constraints.

Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic grasping have led to its integration as a core
module in many manipulation systems. For instance, language-driven semantic
segmentation enables the grasping of any designated object or object part.
However, existing methods often struggle to generate feasible grasp poses for
small objects or delicate components, potentially causing the entire pipeline
to fail. To address this issue, we propose a novel grasping method, FineGrasp,
which introduces improvements in three key aspects. First, we introduce
multiple network modifications to enhance the ability of to handle delicate
regions. Second, we address the issue of label imbalance and propose a refined
graspness label normalization strategy. Third, we introduce a new simulated
grasp dataset and show that mixed sim-to-real training further improves grasp
performance. Experimental results show significant improvements, especially in
grasping small objects, and confirm the effectiveness of our system in semantic
grasping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVC手术的成功率受限于解剖变异和操作者依赖性，错误可能导致严重并发症。机器人系统虽能提供解决方案，但实现完全自主仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用深度图像识别解剖标志，机器人规划扫描路径，分割和重建血管，定位最佳插入区域，并在超声引导下进行针插入。

Conclusion: 这是首个在高仿真模型上验证的集成规划、扫描和插入的机器人CVC系统，展示了临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure
for vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its
success remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided
visualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further
complicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle
placement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems
offer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In
this work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,
from scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a
deep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a
depth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously
define the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework
is proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and
arteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.
Finally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance
with operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity
commercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The
proposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the
first attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15
\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less
than or close to 1 \textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first
robotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated
planning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for
clinical translation.

Result: 算法能够准确估计语音工作负荷，并在不同个体和人机协作模式中表现出通用性。

Conclusion: 实时语音工作负荷估计是开发自适应人机系统的关键要素。

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

Abstract: Scrubbing surfaces is a physically demanding and time-intensive task.
Removing adhered contamination requires substantial friction generated through
pressure and torque or high lateral forces. Rigid robotic manipulators, while
capable of exerting these forces, are usually confined to structured
environments isolated from humans due to safety risks. In contrast, soft robot
arms can safely work around humans and adapt to environmental uncertainty, but
typically struggle to transmit the continuous torques or lateral forces
necessary for scrubbing. Here, we demonstrate a soft robotic arm scrubbing
adhered residues using torque and pressure, a task traditionally challenging
for soft robots. We train a neural network to learn the arm's inverse
kinematics and elasticity, which enables open-loop force and position control.
Using this learned model, the robot successfully scrubbed burnt food residue
from a plate and sticky fruit preserve from a toilet seat, removing an average
of 99.7% of contamination. This work demonstrates how soft robots, capable of
exerting continuous torque, can effectively and safely scrub challenging
contamination from surfaces.

Conclusion: 该框架在多机器人协调搜索任务中表现出色，显著提升了效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In disaster response or surveillance operations, quickly identifying areas
needing urgent attention is critical, but deploying response teams to every
location is inefficient or often impossible. Effective performance in this
domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize
inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also
minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must
directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional
attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for
coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach
uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing
attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a
multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated
experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by
16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to
non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world
platforms using quad-copters.

Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world

Abstract: Perching on structures such as trees, beams, and ledges is essential for
extending the endurance of aerial robots by enabling energy conservation in
standby or observation modes. A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a
simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and
accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile
perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise
management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack &
tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring
by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work,
we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching,
utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from
Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal
demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness,
achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables
the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating
reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through
extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness
in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

manipulation attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data
manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to
93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了安德森局域化与GNN过平滑的联系，并提出了通过减少信息传播无序性来缓解过平滑的理论可能性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理外生输入时存在冗余和长期依赖捕捉不足的问题。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于11个基线模型，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为时间序列预测中利用外生输入提供了一种鲁棒且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释人工智能（XAI）的深度神经网络（DNN）压缩方法，通过梯度技术计算参数重要性，结合剪枝和混合精度量化，显著减小模型尺寸且保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN在任务中表现优异但计算和内存成本高，压缩技术（如剪枝和量化）可将其部署在资源受限的边缘设备上。XAI方法能帮助理解DNN内部机制，从而优化压缩。

Method: 使用梯度技术（LRP）计算DNN参数的重要性分数，剪除负或零重要性参数，并对权重进行混合精度量化（高重要性高分位数，低重要性低分位数）。

Result: 模型尺寸减少64%，精度提升42%，优于现有XAI压缩方法。

Conclusion: XAI驱动的压缩方法有效平衡模型尺寸和精度，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

Motivation: 局部应力场预测对断裂分析和局部疲劳准则至关重要，传统方法计算成本高。

Method: 将周期性微结构表示为图，结合消息传递图神经网络，并引入物理约束和周期性边界条件。

Result: 在线性和非线性超弹性响应下表现良好，非线性情况下比有限元模拟显著加速。

Conclusion: P-DivGNN在大规模应用中具有潜力，尤其在非线性情况下计算效率高。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Conclusion: NeVe展示了神经速度在训练优化中的潜力，减少了对验证集的依赖。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping
criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents
NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Conclusion: 该方法为RCPSP提供了新的解决思路，支持GPU并行化，具有潜在的高效性。

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

Method: 提出HEPO框架，通过最大化策略改进而非策略不变性，避免奖励黑客问题，有效利用启发式奖励。

Result: HEPO在标准基准测试中表现优异，即使启发式奖励设计不佳也能取得良好效果。

Conclusion: HEPO为强化学习中启发式奖励的有效利用提供了新思路，显著减少了人工设计奖励的负担。

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

Conclusion: 模型支持基础模型的关键能力（如少样本泛化和高效适应），并强调了在结构化数据表示学习中编码因果结构的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

Result: RFT能保留先验知识并提升通用能力，而SFT会导致灾难性遗忘和性能下降。

Conclusion: RFT是持续后训练的优越范式，并提出了一种基于rollout的实例过滤算法以优化RFT的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide

Conclusion: RepLIn通过显式利用干预数据的因果独立性，显著降低了干预分布变化下的预测误差，且具有可扩展性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Conclusion: MVMO攻击方法在财务欺诈中具有显著效果，且通过与律师和专业会计师合作，确保威胁模型的现实性。

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

*Prady Saligram,Tanvir Bhathal,Robby Manihani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分布式的多步强化学习框架，用于优化长时程性能，并在2048游戏中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 延迟和稀疏奖励是强化学习中的主要障碍，尤其是在2048游戏中，即时反馈可能导致局部最优但全局次优的策略。

Method: 开发了四种代理变体：标准DQN、PPO、QR-DQN和新型H-DQN，后者结合了分布学习、决斗架构、噪声网络和优先回放等技术。

Result: H-DQN表现最佳，最高得分达41.828K并达到4096方块，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 分布式的多步目标显著提升了稀疏奖励领域的性能，未来可通过基于模型的规划和课程学习进一步优化。

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于前向-后向表示（FB）的探索策略，以优化零样本强化学习中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本强化学习需要在缺乏具体奖励的情况下快速适应未来问题，而现有方法通常依赖其他探索算法。作者认为FB表示应直接用于探索以提高效率。

Method: 设计了基于FB表示的探索策略，最小化其后验方差，从而减少认知不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，这种探索策略显著提高了FB算法的样本效率。

Conclusion: FB表示的自然探索策略能有效提升零样本强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过将动态遗憾最小化问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，利用RKHS框架，实现了对线性损失的最优动态遗憾保证，并扩展到更广泛的损失序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线凸优化中的动态遗憾问题，旨在通过函数空间的方法解决与任意基准序列竞争的问题。

Method: 通过将动态遗憾问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，并利用RKHS框架设计算法。

Result: 在线性损失下实现了最优动态遗憾保证，并在更广泛的损失序列中得到了新的无尺度和方向自适应的动态遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于线性损失，还能扩展到其他损失序列，且算法在实际中可计算。

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于替代随机最优控制目标的无训练扩散引导框架（SDG），通过校正近似后验以保持对真实扩散后验的忠实性，显著提升了扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机最优控制（SOC）在扩散模型微调中表现出色，但计算成本高；而现有的无训练方法虽快速但近似后验误差大，导致引导不可靠。本文旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出Stein Diffusion Guidance（SDG），通过Stein变分推断校正近似后验，并引入新的运行成本函数以在低密度区域实现有效引导。

Result: 在分子生成任务中，SDG显著优于标准的无训练引导方法。

Conclusion: SDG为扩散模型提供了一种高效且可靠的引导框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

Abstract: We present an integrated graph-based neural networks architecture for
predicting campus buildings occupancy and inter-buildings movement at dynamic
temporal resolution that learns traffic flow patterns from Wi-Fi logs combined
with the usage schedules within the buildings. The relative traffic flows are
directly estimated from the WiFi data without assuming the occupant behaviour
or preferences while maintaining individual privacy. We formulate the problem
as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing
buildings), connected through a route of edges or links using a novel Graph
Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our
proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models
significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

Abstract: User growth is a major strategy for consumer internet companies. To optimize
costly marketing campaigns and maximize user engagement, we propose a novel
treatment effect optimization methodology to enhance user growth marketing. By
leveraging deep learning, our algorithm learns from past experiments to
optimize user selection and reward allocation, maximizing campaign impact while

jointly optimize parameters for an aggregated loss function using softmax
gating. Our approach surpasses traditional methods by directly targeting
desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including
comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques such as R-learner and Causal
Forest, validate the effectiveness of our model. We experimentally demonstrate
that our proposed constrained and direct optimization algorithms significantly
outperform state-of-the-art methods by over $20\%$, proving their

<details>

Motivation: 随着HTE估计在科学和工业应用中的普及，处理策略空间从二元扩展到结构化策略，需要更通用的方法。

Method: 通过神经增强朴素贝叶斯层结合多变量处理策略，直接排序个体HTE函数。

Result: 在公共数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度学习异质处理策略提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

Result: MACE-TNP在实验中表现优于强贝叶斯基线。

Conclusion: 元学习为复杂贝叶斯因果推断提供了一种灵活且可扩展的范式，适用于未来更具挑战性的场景。

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

Motivation: 现有方法在缓解模型对捷径特征的依赖时存在模型特定性、调参困难、计算成本高和表征学习效果不佳等问题。

Method: 提出 InterpoLL，通过插值多数类别的表示以包含少数类别的特征，削弱捷径特征的影响。

Result: 在多个自然语言理解任务中，InterpoLL 显著提升了少数类别的泛化能力，且不影响多数类别的准确性。

Conclusion: InterpoLL 是一种广泛适用的方法，适用于多种架构，能有效缓解捷径特征问题。

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了硬件加速器在GNN中的安全挑战，尤其是硬件故障攻击对模型性能的潜在威胁。

Method: GBFA采用两步策略：1）基于马尔可夫模型预测攻击目标层；2）通过梯度排序在目标层中识别脆弱比特位并翻转。

Result: 实验表明，GBFA在Cora和PubMed数据集上显著降低了GNN模型的预测精度，例如仅翻转最后一层的1比特位就使GraphSAGE的精度下降17%。

Conclusion: GBFA揭示了GNN模型对硬件故障攻击的脆弱性，强调了逐层攻击策略的重要性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了GCN在跳跃连接和稀疏化下的学习动态，并定义了稀疏有效邻接矩阵$A^*$。

Conclusion: 图稀疏化在保留关键边时可维持泛化性能，跳跃连接对稀疏化需求的分层影响为首次理论揭示。

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and

*Jingyi Gao,Sol Lim,Seokhyun Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合辅助信息的增强负载估计框架，利用深度潜在变量建模与时序卷积网络，提高了手动搬运中负载估计的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常直接从负载步态映射到手部负载，限制了泛化能力和预测准确性。

Method: 结合基线步态模式和搬运风格，采用深度潜在变量建模与时序卷积网络，通过双向交叉注意力融合负载与无负载步态模式。

Result: 实验表明，结合辅助信息和显式融合机制显著提高了负载估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架无需推理时搬运风格标签，通过辅助信息和显式融合机制提升了负载估计性能。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UARL的新框架，通过不确定性感知增强RL策略的安全性，避免在目标域直接交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL在真实世界部署中的分布偏移、安全问题和直接交互不切实际的问题。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准和四足机器人上验证了UARL的有效性，表现出可靠的OOD检测、性能提升和样本效率。

Conclusion: UARL提供了一种安全、高效的RL训练方法，无需目标域直接交互即可实现鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

Motivation: 人类通常只能同时处理少量任务，但能通过已完成任务的经验预学习未完成任务的可能解决方案。论文旨在形式化这一现象，并开发一种算法来模拟这种能力。

Method: 提出“多任务预演”算法，通过重放已完成任务的经验，模拟未完成任务的可能情况，学习预测性表征以支持快速适应。

Result: 实验表明，该算法能更准确地预测人类在未完成任务中的表现，并在Craftax环境中提升AI的迁移学习能力。

Conclusion: 多任务预演是一种可扩展的理论，能显著提升AI在复杂多任务环境中的性能。

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

Motivation: 衍射光学网络是实现高速、高效信息处理的有前景平台，但其优化和对齐受限于硬件缺陷和噪声，现有原位优化方法收敛慢且不稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法无需系统建模即可直接应用于物理系统，为复杂光学和物理系统提供了可扩展的训练框架。

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that
integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based
neural architectures. By transforming the original PDEs into spectral ordinary
differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate
training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the
spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional
Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve
highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better
than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting
future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data,
bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex
dynamical systems.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early
graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph
neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable
architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,
explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of
graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is
significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships
that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting
real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to
recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like
scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and
trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey
provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key
dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,
and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for
efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal
dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph
samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We
also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure
responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and
discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and
other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey
serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to
navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of graph learning.

Result: 实验验证FACT在收敛时的有效性，FACT-RFM在表格数据上表现优异，并能捕捉神经网络训练中的特征学习行为。

Conclusion: FACT为理解神经网络特征学习提供了理论工具，FACT-RFM展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

Motivation: 深度学习内核开发需要手动调优关键参数（如瓦片大小和内存访问模式），过程繁琐且性能难以优化。AutoTriton旨在通过强化学习自动完成这一过程。

Method: AutoTriton结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），使用GRPO算法优化Triton编程能力，并通过规则和执行的奖励机制进一步提升性能。

Result: 在TritonBench和KernelBench的五个评估通道中，AutoTriton-8B模型的性能与主流大模型（如Claude-4-Sonnet和DeepSeek-R1-0528）相当。

Conclusion: AutoTriton展示了强化学习在自动生成高性能内核中的潜力，为构建更高效的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code
will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency

Abstract: Cardiac diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide, which requires accurate and timely diagnostic strategies. In this
study, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image
registration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical
properties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease
classification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean
material to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field
while ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable
approach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides
insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.
Evaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved
Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

Motivation: 现有图预测方法假设顶点不变，无法适应动态变化，需改进。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（UCI Message、HePH、Facebook、Bitcoin）上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效预测动态图结构，适用于顶点变化的场景。

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

*Marco Roschkowski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Soup-Adapter的方法，通过训练多个独立的适配器并平均其输出，解决了少样本领域适应中的超参数调优和分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本领域适应中因缺乏大规模验证数据集而难以调优超参数的问题，以及模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 训练多个独立的适配器，平均其输出以提高性能和鲁棒性，即使适配器使用不同的超参数训练。

Result: 新模型性能更高，对分布偏移更鲁棒，且对关键超参数（如残差比例）的敏感性显著降低。

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter通过集成和参数重参数化，有效解决了少样本领域适应中的两大问题，并首次探索了DINOv2的适配器技术。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

Conclusion: 该框架模型无关且可扩展，为理解深度学习模型的泛化行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at

Conclusion: 论文通过信息论视角和帕累托优化，成功解决了公平领域泛化问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Motivation: 扩散模型训练资源需求高，现有方法主要针对判别模型，缺乏对生成模型的数据集压缩研究。

Method: D2C框架包括选择阶段（基于扩散难度评分和间隔采样）和附加阶段（增强语义和视觉表示）。

Result: 实验表明，D2C在仅使用0.8%数据时，训练速度提升100倍，FID得分4.3。

Conclusion: D2C为扩散模型提供了一种高效的数据集压缩方法，显著降低训练成本。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart
sound classification, label noise reduction, machine learning, XGBoost,

<details>

Motivation: 尽管Adam在深度神经网络训练中表现优异，但其理论收敛分析仍不完善，现有方法需要强假设和复杂技术。

Method: 将Adam重新解释为符号类优化器，简化了收敛性分析的数学表达。

Result: 在更弱的假设下，证明了Adam的最优收敛速率为${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$，并揭示了动量在收敛中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 新解释简化了理论分析，提供了实际调参指导，缩小了理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

Abstract: The high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) setting presents significant

that split the high-dimensional feature vectors into smaller subsets, each
representing a different view. Extensive experimental validation across
model-types and learning tasks confirm the effectiveness and generalization of
the approach. We believe the work in this paper lays the foundation for further
research into the universal benefits of multi-view mid fusion learning.

Conclusion: LGCNN为复杂物理过程提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代建模方法，适用于实际工程应用。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

Result: QAT将SSM复杂度降低两个数量级，增强了对模拟噪声的鲁棒性，并成功部署于忆阻器模拟内存计算平台。

Conclusion: QAT显著提升了SSM在边缘计算设备上的计算效率，为资源受限场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

### [92] [CoRE: Enhancing Metacognition with Label-free Self-evaluation in LRMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06087)
*Haoxi Li,Sikai Bai,Jie Zhang,Song Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding (CoRE)方法，通过分析隐藏状态的几何特性，实现无标签的自我评估，以减少大型推理模型（LRMs）的冗余推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中常出现过度思考（overthinking）现象，导致效率低下。研究旨在让模型自主评估其推理轨迹的正确性，无需外部标签。

Method: 提出CoRE方法，利用潜在空间中的隐藏状态序列进行无标签自我评估，并基于几何特性识别冗余推理（表现为循环波动）。进一步提出CoRE-Eval框架，动态决定是否提前终止推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试（GSM8K、MATH-500、AIME）中，CoRE-Eval将推理链长度减少13.7%至33.2%，同时提高答案准确率约10%，32B模型在AIME上达到70.0%准确率。

Conclusion: CoRE方法通过无标签自我评估和动态终止机制，显著提升了大型推理模型的推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

TL;DR: 提出了ZO-SAH方法，通过随机选择二维子空间估计Hessian矩阵，显著降低计算成本，并在实验中表现出更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零阶优化中梯度信息不可用或计算成本高的问题，同时利用二阶信息加速收敛。

Method: 基于子空间的近似Hessian方法（ZO-SAH），通过拟合二次多项式估计Hessian，并采用周期性子空间切换策略减少函数查询成本。

Result: 在八个基准数据集（包括逻辑回归和深度神经网络训练任务）上，ZO-SAH比现有零阶方法收敛更快。

Conclusion: ZO-SAH通过高效利用二阶信息，显著提升了零阶优化的收敛速度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于层次非负矩阵分解和布尔矩阵分解的AI驱动框架，用于预测科学文献网络中的隐藏关联，并验证了其在材料科学领域的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献网络和知识图谱通常规模大、稀疏且噪声多，存在实体间缺失链接的问题，需要一种方法预测隐藏关联并促进跨学科探索。

Method: 结合层次非负矩阵分解（HNMFk）、布尔矩阵分解（BNMFk）和逻辑矩阵分解（LMF），构建三级主题树，并通过自动模型选择优化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从科学文献中发现隐藏关联，特别适用于多学科背景下的材料研究，并通过交互式工具支持科学发现。

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Result: 推导了随机核卷积层的混叠效应期望值和方差的闭式表达式，揭示了初始化时的混叠行为。

Conclusion: 通过抑制混叠，优化目标能有效提升Parseval稳定性，为卷积层的设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了通过连接优化实现高效布尔逻辑网络的潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in
Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a
probability distribution over a subset of connections per gate input, selecting
the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection
LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only
a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

Conclusion: 研究表明差分设计需针对Mamba进行专门调整，新机制显著提升了模型效果。

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.
